Hey there!

My name is Seth Moeckel, and I really enjoy designing & building digital products. I was about 12 years old when I started messing with computers. I really didn't understand much, but I wanted to know how things worked, and how I could make my ideas real. I started taking appliances apart, building robots with microcontrollers, and writing small scripts for my Raspberry Pi. It took a while but I began to grasp programming, and how to build my own programs. 

Fast-forward to today, and I've been a software engineer for a little over 6 years. I've worked freelance, in several startups, and a few larger companies. I've built web apps, mobile apps, APIs, infrastructure, big-data systems, low-level windows/linux systems apps and much more. My focus lately has been building the high-end mobile and backend software required to drive amazing digital experiences.

Aside from my work, I enjoy time spent outdoors, cooking (mediterranean is among my favorites), and traveling to visit friends from all over.

I'm a self-taught software engineer based in Columbus (happy to work remote), and an aspiring UI/UX designer. I am a quick study and a lifelong innovator. I look forward to any opportunity to work with anyone who's passionate about solving real problems and building amazing products.
