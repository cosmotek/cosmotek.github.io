Over 5  years of experience working with various technologies including web & mobile development, systems and infrastructure work, big data and more. I'm driven, intuitive, resourceful, optimistic, quick to learn, and I lead by serving first. I'm a self-taught self-starter, I love design and solving problems. I've worked in start-ups and midsized companies, and as a freelancer or consultant. I’m always excited to work with other passionate people to build something great!
